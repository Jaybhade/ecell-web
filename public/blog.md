Beginnings make the conditions perfect.*

Want to become independent and be your own boss? Want to maybe even finance your own education further? Then you may probably be thinking to start a business. Owning one's own business is one of the most comforting yet demanding choice. As the name suggests, you have to start a 'start-up' at any point of life. And you can’t be sure to start earning a profit right away or make it stable in just a few days. It takes patience and skills. Though, you can start a business anytime in your life but college time is the best time to do so. We’ll be seeing why so in this article.

### 1. No Risk Experiments:
In college life, you are not bound by any liabilities and do not have a burden on your shoulders. So, this is the time when you can experiment
businesses with no or least risk. Even if you fail, you have nothing to lose.

### 2. Best Resources Available:
It is the time of your life when all of the best Resources are available to you. For example, you have with you, the college’s library, labs, infrastructure, etc. These things will cost much later on in life and might not be available even.

### 3. Guidance:
In college, you have guidance of your professors and seniors to support your business. This guidance is much precious so, use it judiciously.

### 4. Contact with Alumni:
You have contact with the people who would have done something similar in their lives and can guide you about their mistakes or experiences which would in turn, help you not to commit similar mistakes.

### 5. Financial Help:
Since, you are under no or negligible monitory liability, you have the best time in the life to get financial helps. For instance, if your college has an E-Cell, it might help you financially or might help you get help from Government to get your business started and running.

### 6. Know your Passion: 
It is the best time where you can experiment and get to know what gives you the kick in life. What makes you feel lively. This would help you to live life doing what you like and hence make your attitude positive.

### 7. Low Cost Partners: 
College life supplies you with free or low cost dedicated partners, i.e., your friends. They can help you and work with you giving away their hard work for you at a very low cost as compared to other sources.

### 8. Time: 
The most important of the resources is 'time'. And in college, you have the most of it. Once, you pass out of the college, you’ll be engaged with your job and other liabilities which will take away most of your time. But while in college, you have time to establish your business.

### 9. Easy to target Customers: 
While at College, you may have the subset of your target audience right away in your connections or can easily reach out to them. You have a lot of sources to reach audience while at college.

### 10. Backup: 
Even if your start-up fails, you are getting your degree from the college anyways and will carry experience which will help you later in life. You can anyways get a job even if you fail in the business when you do it in the college life.

So, now that you have seen the reasons, what are you waiting for? Think of an idea and start right away! Remember, even science says, “Static Friction is greater than Kinetic Friction.” So, it is always difficult to start but once you’re running, you have the dedication to overcome the obstacles that come your way.
